   Z z
 _z_   Bunny has den up.
(_±_)

1. Fixed down arrow making number a zero, if nothing was entered yet.
2. New targets in Makefile.
3. Improved error checking for mpv, when it quits.
4. Fixed possible double call for export_sesion_data on exit.
5. Fixed one bug which caused watch.sh to play the first item from the list
   after playing an item that was chosen under certain circumstances
   in cycle mode. The solution brought another revision to the session-
   related parts of code, so old sessions from the journal won’t be valid.
6. Fixed a fresh and juicy bug: when watch.sh was prompting for stopping
   watching cycle, it didn’t take into account that some keys are actually
   returned as multiple chars, e.g. right arrow is ^[[C, where ^[ is
   a sequence for the escape code. That means if one rewinded an episode
   with the right arrow _and hold it_ to make ‘read’ take that key and
   not wait 3 seconds for its timeout, this caused ^[ to become an input
   character to ‘read’ and ‘[’ with ‘C’ are to be taken by mpv and
   interpreted as key commands, which, in their turn, caused mpv
   to decrease speed by multiplying it by 0.9 each time. Now replies from
   such keys are intercepted accordingly.
7. Brought some order to variable names and done a little of code cleaning.
8. SCREENSHOT_DIR is now cumulative and is exported to the journal
  (but not required at retrieving). It is done to make watch.sh not ask
   the user each time he starts it with ‘-r’ key for what _exactly_ folder
   does he want, if there are several folders in the path specified after
   --screenshot-dir that matched the KEYWORD.
9. Finally long-awaited support for remembering sub-delay between episodes
   was added! To make use of it, please see the corresponding subsection
   of EXAMPLES OF USE in the man page. Here’s the code to jump there:

   $ man -P"less -p '^\s*Remembering subtitles.*delay.*'" watch.sh

   P.S. this works only with mpv.
   P.P.S. audio-delay can be remembered, too.
10. Update checker is written. Now each 21 day (by default) watch.sh will
    check the repo on github and report either about new version available,
    or that the current version is the latest. The behaviour of the updater
    is customizeable via -u and --check-for-update options.

(~.~) Bunny has fell asleep.

1. Fix the issue when multiple basepaths are enclosed.
2. Update the Makefile to make it truly handy.

(^(^(^ )  Buппy is glad тo have coмrades.
( ( (  )*

1. Fix an error when script tried to check an empty KEYWORD for pattern.
2. Fix an error when SCREENSHOT_DIR_SKEL is empty, which led to
   an incorrectly eval’ed string, and result depended on the bash version.
3. Fix bug caused by the old code preventing CHOSEN_ONE and SUBFOLDERS
   element paths to be put into journal if MODE is 'single'.

(….…) Bunny met changes he wanted more than a 1-ri long carrot.
(> <)

1. Fix screenshots left raw if they were put into the current directory.
2. Fixed loading of external files that have v[number] after the episode
   number. Implemented debugging for that part of code.
3. Fix journal entries which VIDEOFILES variable contained files with
   single quote in their names and which couldn’t load properly because
   of that.
4. Improve util-linux version check.
5. Make error message about an empty folder hinting for a possible
   mistake which some weird patterns in --subfolders could lead to.
6. --mplayer-opts is now cumulative.
7. Add .mka to the tracks extensions.
8. The keyword now can be a pattern!
   The -f switch that tells watch.sh to treat keyword as a fixed string,
   may be used to use ‘.’ ‘*’ and ‘|’ in the pattern.
   Also entries from your journal will become invalid after update, this
   is normal, there’s just two new variables, and one of them
   required to be present.
9. Arrow keys are now working in the menu! So selecting an item is as
   simple as pressing “up” and “down”. The update introduces two new
   options for used-defined keys to increment and decrement the number
   besides the arrow keys. They are --my-increment and --my-decrement.
10. Other little changes, code cleanup and bugfixes.

===] August 25, 2014 [=====================================================

1. Added additional check before creation of an empty journal.
2. Make --subfolders recognize %keyword.
3. Fix unique files that do not start a sequence not appearing in the list
  (unique_lines was appended via newline to itself instead of
   to LIST_TO_CHOOSE_FROM). Also fix numbering for those lines and high-
   liting KEYWORD in the filenames. Start using GRE for grep.
4. Fix check for setting HEURISTICS_LEVEL a value higher than
   MAX_HEURISTICS_LEVEL.

Migration from the “scripts” repository.

1. watch.sh now runs as an executable. Edit your aliases.

2. Option parsing was transferred from getopts to getopt, long options
   finally appeared.
   Most short options left untouched, the change was made to:
   -j (--jpeg-compression) now takes an optional argument, that may be
     a number from 0 to 100; It represents screenshot compress ratio
	 after conversion to jpeg. The default is 92;
   -l (--last-ep) takes no argument, it only enables printing the number
     of the last shown episode; it also sets to default the command, the
	 format and a new parameter that specifies whether the script shall
	 print the number after player stops (and before screenshot proces-
	 sing starts) or after processing; the command, the format and when
	 to show episode number may be overriden by the newly introduced
	 parameters:
	 --last-ep-command is supposed to be a command line calling
       figlet/toilet;
	 --last-ep-format takes format;
	 --last-ep-show-after takes an argument that can be one of ‘player’,
       ‘screenshots’ or ‘both’ (it is never shown twice);
   -N (--dvd-bd-nav) now adds “nav” string to both dvd and bd protocols,
     but bdnav is only available for mpv.
   -P (don’t pad episode number) was removed due to fixes described
     below with which the purpose of this option was gone.
   The behaviour of the -n (--match-number) key has slightly changed,
     and it is not necessary any more to keep it in your aliases. When
	 playing a folder with episodes, watch.sh will look for external
	 files matching both phrase and the episode number automatically.
	 Thus the "-n" key is preseved for the usage when it’s needed
	 to include subtitles containing nothing but an episode number,
	 for example.

3. New options were added.
   --bashrc which is meant to cover the disadvantage of switching to
     the executable form of the script. It’s that aliases couldn’t be
	 exported to the subshell (the script is running in), thus are not
	 available for the usage in the -M (--mplayer-command). With no
	 argument it sources ~/.bashrc or the specified file otherwise.
   --compat option has emerged to solve the issue with divergent
     approaches of player to systematize key names. There are three
	 compatibility modes:
	 - “mplayer” for the original MPlayer;
	 - “mplayer2” for mplayer2;
	 - “mpv-03x” for mpv 0.3.x or older.
	 The script is written to conform with the latest mpv build
    (i.e. git version) which at the present time differs from 0.3.x
	 version, and does not require any compatibility options for usage
	 with the upstream mpv build.
   -j (--list-journal) outputs recently entered phrases from the journal.
   -J (--no-journal) forbids the script to keep the journal.
   --journal-max-size allows to restrict the size journal is allowed
     to take on the disk. The default is 64KiB.
   --screenshot-dir-skel takes a list of comma separated directories
     to be created under the folder specified via --screenshot-dir,
	 e.g. "art,misc".

4. Short options taking an _optional_ argument must _not_ be separated
   from it. Long options taking _an optional_ argument need this
   argument to be passed through the equals sign, i.e. the following
   forms are acceptable
      -j                                      | optional
      -j13                                    | optional
	  -m "--fs"                               | mandatory only
     --bashrc                                 | optional
     --bashrc=$HOME/bashrc/mplayer_aliases.sh | optional
	 --screenshot-dir /home/screenshots       | mandatory only
	 --screenshot-dir=/home/screenshots       | mandatory
   This isn’t related to the options taking mandatory argument, where
   the equals sign is optional and arguments may be passed via space
   as well.

5. The script now maintains a journal where it stores recently entered
   phrases and the data necessary to resume watching sessions bound
   to them, so the script doesn’t depend on a permanently open terminal
   any more. A journal makes it possible to simultaneously keep multiple
   watching sessions, and that affected resume procedure behaviour: now
   if a phrase was given along with the -r option, it will search
   the journal for that phrase; in case the phrase is not given, it will
   pick the last session by default.

6. The script can be given multiple basepaths. If there is a folder where
   titles are stored and another folder where new ones downloaded, it
   would be convenient to have script watch both folders so there will be
   no need to move them from a download folder to the storage. Basepaths
   are passed through the -d (--basedir|--basepath) option. The first is
   supposed to be the storage and thus takes priority, so if the match
   with the same name would be found in more than one path, duplicates
   won’t be shown.

7. Fix input to terminal. Now while choosing a number, input is restric-
   ted to numbers and incorrect input may be erased with backspace.

8. Improved escaping of sed expressions to get rid of lots of bugs rela-
   ted to special characters in file names of videos and external files.

9. Fix simultaneous loading of subtitles and tracks (multiple tracks are
   only available in the latest mpv).

10. Fix bug with non-working conversion to JPEG due to flag variable
	being unexported to the function called in the subshell.

11. Added support for bd:// protocol (br:// for MPlayer). -I option now
	allows to play a folder ignoring _any_ disk structure, whether it is
	DVD or BD. Some instructions were added to the ~/.magic file enabling
	to recognize MPEG 2 Transport (MP2T) streams as video files.

12. Fixes to the ‘single’ and ‘episodes’ modes.

13. More intelligent episode numbering, requiring heuristic level >=1.
	The number of an episode that has been watched is now defined via
	file name pattern of the largest group (See “Using heuristics” sub-
	section in man page) created while building the list and is not
	dependent on the position in the list anymore. EPISODE_NUMBER is
	currently used only when looking for subtitles and tracks and
	to display it after the playback is finished; it will also be used
	for MAL intergration in the future. Position in the list is now defi-
	ned via VIDEO_ITEM.

14. Heuristics second level finally debugged and works properly now. Tra-
	cing this part of code was delaying for long, but inevitable. The in-
	terface	now highlights not the phrase, but the part of the filename
	which corresponds to the group pattern, if heuristics level is grea-
	ter than 0.

15. Debug output for the hardest places of code implemented. Files are
	stored to "~/.watch.sh/debug/". To enable it, export D variable
	to the environment of the script. This will also output the group
	numbers.

16. Minor fixes to error reporting, old code and commentaries. A little
	of code cleaning, moved check_for_subfolders() and
	check_for_disk_stuff() related to do_initial_search() closer
	to the last.

17. Dependency from awk removed. For conversion to jpeg the script now
	uses pngtopam from netpbm and cjpeg from libjpeg-turbo instead of
	imagemagick to make the list or required packages more minimalistic.

18. Please note, that since mplayer2 development was dropped, it is not
	officially supported by this program, which uses syntax of the keys
	depending on what MPLAYER_COMMAND contains or the value passed
	to --compat option.

19. Version number and man page!
    Like a decent program, it finally comes with them.

	Yes, yes… GNU standards frown upon UNIX man pages.
