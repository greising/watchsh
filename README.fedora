This script has optional dependencies making it work better, but this
  functionality may be not needed for all users, so there are two RPM
  packages, one is the actual package, which is called “watchsh-base”
  having only strong dependencies, and the other one is meta package
  “watchsh” which depends on watchsh-base and the optional packages.

Due to impossibility to specify conditional dependency for mplayer,
  mplayer2 or mpv, the latter was chosen as the player required.
